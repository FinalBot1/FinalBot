## The printer

![Imagem 1](/Img/03.jpg)

An unlimited 3D printer, designed to be adaptable to any FDM technology.

Key Features:
- Constant updates according to market innovations (components, software, systems, etc.)
- Improvements can be made in stages, following your learning curve or financial availability.
- 220x220mm heatbed with Z=250mm printing height (frame and travel limits expandable in the future).
- Core XY system, but allowing for many other kinematics in the future.
- Printing speed: 300, 500, 800, 1000mm/s...  It will depend on 3 factors: driver assembly, hotend flow rate and parameters.
- Applicable to all firmwares.
- Allows for various electronics.
- Works with multiple slicers.
- With creativity, it is possible to use some parts from your old 3D printer.
- Video instructions on the internet for each improvement released (coming soon).
- 100% OPEN SOURCE (use only for makers and contributors without commercial - see our license).

## Files for everyone

The basic designs were created in 2D CAD with dxf format.
The idea is to ensure that anyone has access to the construction drawings, even if they don't have a computer.
We recommend using a dwg/dxf editor to measure and manipulate the files.
If you are using android GnaCAD is the best option in our opinion.
On a PC LibreCAD is excellent.
There are many other CAD2D options, choose the one you prefer.
They are not 3D files so you don't need an expensive or student license or even a powerful computer.

## An endless system

Finalbot was designed as an RPG game, where you level up as you progress. But in this case you advance as you change parts and make upgrades. The main difference is that the limit will not be level 99 but the technology in evidence at the moment (without having to build a new printer).
Was it difficult to design a system like this? yes; was it laborious? very much; is it an impossible idea? It's not impossible.
We believe in technological evolution through open source and open hardware policy.
It's not just about a cheap printer. We are talking about a machine that can be constantly improved.
There are excellent DIY printers today, but the differential of FinalBot is to allow changes and upgrades in the same structure. These upgrades or mods are fully open to almost any type of component for sale on the market.

## Possibilities

We are excited to add a number of upgrades and mods. We are currently working on developing DIY magnetic linear motors for the FinalBot. Also on other types of drives that have potential for the future.
We also have projects for a heated chamber, dual hotend, voice-activated menus, multi-filament feeding, ATC for hotends, enclousure in countless colors, there are many things, many indeed.

## Our mission

Our mission will always be to reduce the gap between new 3D printing technologies (mainly proprietary) and DIY 3D printers.
About 99% of everything that exists today commercially in fdm printers was thanks to the maker community. Most of what is sold was based on countless advances and tests by ordinary users.
However, we have noticed that the latest technological advances have occurred more sharply in commercial projects than in diy communities.
We don't want the market to be entirely dominated by closed systems. If this continues, for sure at some point the maker and diy community will be outdated from proprietary technologies (this has not happened yet but may happen soon).
We want and will contribute to the strengthening of the maker and open source culture.

## But we need you

We need your help to fund this project. We are doing everything in our power not to disappoint.
Put your trust in this project and you will not regret it.
If you buy us a coffee we will be very honored, but not only that.
You will receive several drawings with more details and some basic mods.
Click below and see the details on our contribution page.

Note: We are giving gifts (CAD drawings) to users who donate, to subsidize the project and its mods. All money donated will be allocated entirely to the development of the project (purchase of parts, filaments, new items, etc.). Soon several mods and upgrades will be available on this github page.

## Who are we?

First and foremost, enthusiasts passionate about 3D printing. Secondly, dreamers with the vision that wherever you are, whether in a country with resources, whether in a small town, whether in California, whether in Alaska or on the moon, EVERYONE can have a 3D printer and print at home.
And finally, we are professionals specialized in the areas of development engineering and industrial manufacturing. With extensive experience in machines and systems, we make complex things understandable.
